            Hi, my name is Ryan Lewalski. I am a computer science student at Utah State University
             with a passion for web applications. I think the amount of creativity and problem solving 
             that goes into web development is a lot of fun to me. I love the idea of being able to create 
             something that can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world. 

            I plan on focusing my learning on machine learning and AI, as well as learning more about VR and AR.

            When I'm not working on projects or school, you can usually find me playing video games, reading, 
            hiking, playing sports, or traveling. I'm always excited to connect and meet new people aswell!

            Thank you for visiting my website and learning more about me! I hope you enjoy your time here 
            and find something that interests you.
            </p>
