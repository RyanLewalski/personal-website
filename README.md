# personal-website

Instructions for my person website:

This is going to be my personal website that I show to employers. This will contain information about me, information about my projects that I have worked on and built, and other things like my resume and experience.

What I want to include on the website:

1. I want a home page that has clickable links to other pages. This home page will have a summary about what this website is. I want to have seperate links to my github and resume.

2. I want to have a link and a page that goes to my prior projects and descriptions and downloads/links to these projects.

3. I want to have a link and a page that goes to my work experience. This will mainly include internships, and major work experience, but for now, it will include prior jobs in general.

4. I want to have a contact me page. This will have all of my information.
